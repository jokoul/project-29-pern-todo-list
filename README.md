# project-29-pern-todo-list

## Description

this is a todo-list app made with PERN stack technology and allow you to organise your task. I use PERN stack that's mean Postgresql as database management system, Express.js as library to create the REST API, React.js as framework to build client-side interface and Node.js as Javascript runtime platform to run javascript by server-side. I need to create an heroku postgresql databse for deployment by using this command : heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a pern-todo-list-joan

## Stack

Postgresql, Node.js, React.js,

## Launch
